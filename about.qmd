Hi, I am a Deep Learning practitioner, currently working as a Data Scientist at [Turing](https://www.turing.com/). I am based in Thane, Maharashtra. I am an avid fantasy fiction reader and I like playing chess. I have been practicing deep learning for almost two years now and I am excited to grow in this field!

I am a 2025 graduate from Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, where I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering. This is where I first got into machine learning and deep learning, starting off with Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) course on Coursera, and eventually doing the fast.ai course: [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai).

While at IIT Varanasi, I did a summer internship as a Data Scientist at [Voiceback Analytics](https://voicebackanalytics.com/), where I led promotion analytics for Mumbai International Airportâ€™s duty-free stores. I developed a pipeline to extract transactional data and trained machine learning models to identify the most effective promotions. Apart from the internship, I did various projects to cement my practical understanding. Check out some of my notable side projects [here](index.qmd).

I am always open to connecting and collaborating, feel free to reach out:
